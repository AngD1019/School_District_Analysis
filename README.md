# School_District_Analysis

## While performing analysis on the student data, I noticed that the average school budgets for public schools is about $40,000 greater than the average budgets for charter schools. This can help inform budgeting needs for schools across districts and can open the department up to conducting further analysis on the reasons behind this difference in funding and whether it makes sense for these different types of schools. Secondly, having access to the number of students at high schools is important data for many different aspects of studying school statistics, including understanding budgets and looking at academic scores. Knowing which schools having higher student populations than others will help in understanding what they need and the progress they make. For example, Montgomery High School has the highest student population at 2038 students, which will mean that their budget, test scores, and needs will look different than Chang High School, which has 171 students. Lastly, being able to look at the average math scores in public and charter schools, and to see these scores by grade, can help the district see where the greatest needs are for math intervention across schools. For example, we can see that 9th grade in charter schools have the highest math scores, but the average math score decreases across charter schools as students advance in high school. This is just one example of an aspect that could merit a deeper dive to understand the why behind these numbers and what can be done to support these students and teachers in increasing scores.
